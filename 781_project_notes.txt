Plans towards 781 poster

Writing up the draft of the poster. Have it done over the weekend. 

Ben:

Discretely approximate real world trace reuse distance distribution.

Brandon:

The analysis code to give an intuitive feeling of how the policy is going to
improve over LRU. (It requires matplotlib package, however. It you don't want
it, just comment out the import line and the 209th line in compressedMDP.py)

Extend multi-modal example analytically.

Minor modification: set value function domain as big as RDD suggests.
